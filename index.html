 <h2>Engineering Journal</h2>
 

<p>9/2 - This week we worked on a CAD challage building a kitchen appliance</p> 
<p>9/16 - This week we started designing our rube goldberg project on tinkercad </p>
<p>9/23 - This week we were building our rube goldberg machine.</p>
<p>10/3 - This week we made a tinkercad on prosthetics. </p>
<p>10/10 - This week we started cadding a rocket on tinkercad</p>
<p>10/21 - This week we launched our bottle rockets.</p>
<p>11/1 - This week we started to learn about electrical engineering.</p>
<p>11/8 - This week we started to do hands on activities</p>
<P>11/16 - This week we strted Arduino</P>
<p>11/23 - This week we didnt do anything because we had no school.</p>
<p>11/30 - This week we started cading our spaghetti bridge.</p>
<p>12/07 - This week we dessided to change our design. We have already tested twise and they went succesfull. But we want a better outcome.</p>
<p>12/14 - We are finishing up our final product and everything looks good.</p>         
<p>12/21 - This is our last week and we are going to test our final roduct</p>          
<p>01/11 - This week we started learning about buisness engineering.</p>    
<p>01/18 - This week we started to learn about chemical engineering.</p>
<p>01/26 - This week we started making/designing our mouse trap car</p>
<p>02/01 - This week we went into lockdown because of an intruder.</p>
<p>02/10 - Today we did a water ballon challenge. </p>     
<p>03/9 - Throught this six week process my partner and I decided to do the mouse trap car. When we started we struggled with adding on the tires and the base itself. My partner was out for a while due to a sickness so i had to kind of pick up my pace and do the work myself. When he came back we where zooming. We practically finished the whole project in a day. We stayed in during lunch to finish up the project. When the day for testing came we failed and our car didnt move. But since my partner and i were out for a while Mr.Kim gave us an extra day and we completed it. Our car actually went 6 inches, yes we know thats not good but it moved so were happy.<p>

          <p>This link will take you to a video of our rube goldberg and what we did. Our design was to drop the baseball into the cup and the cup would hit the car and push it down. Once the car is pushed down it will pop the ballon with the needle taped on to the car.  </p>

     <p>  This is a picture of a duck with a prosthetic. I made this on tinkercad. The reason i made this was because we were assigned to make a prosthetic for an animal. But the reason i chose a duck was because they are very underated/forgoten and i wanted to design my own for them.</p>

     <p> This is my home applience. I made a microwave on tinkercad. I couldnt finish the numbers you hit to put the time but i finished everything else.</p>

    <p> This is the rocket i designed. We didnt use this one we used Tristans.</p>

   <p> This is a link of our bottle rocket. We got 1st place. Our rocket was designed by water and air pressure.</p>
