          <p>This link will take you to a video of our rube goldberg and what we did. Our design was to drop the baseball into the cup and the cup would hit the car and push it down. Once the car is pushed down it will pop the ballon with the needle taped on to the car.  </p>

     <p>  This is a picture of a duck with a prosthetic. I made this on tinkercad. The reason i made this was because we were assigned to make a prosthetic for an animal. But the reason i chose a duck was because they are very underated/forgoten and i wanted to design my own for them.</p>
